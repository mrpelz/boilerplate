# boilerplate

Easily start new TypeScript-based projects using a modular, extendable toolset. It tries to handle common pitfalls for edge-cases while providing opinionated defaults for everyday-use.

## Usage

> ### ℹ️ Opinion
>
> This Readme will only provide examples for `npm`.
> The supporting scripts all use `npm` internally. Feel free to change them in your project to use `yarn` or something else, but as long as you want to use this boilerplate as-is, stick to `npm`. 🙂
